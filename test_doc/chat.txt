But historically, China has been one of the most tolerant countries for non-binary genders. In China, non-binary gender has never been subjected to massive persecution and repression as in Western countries. Religious beliefs generally dominate the thinking of Western people. For example, Christianity believes that marriage and family must consist of one man and one woman, and anyone who violates God’s will should be punished. In medieval Europe, homosexuality was considered a crime, punishable by hanging or burning. However, in ancient China, people’s attitude towards homosexuality was calm and indifferent, and there were not many praises for homosexuality, nor much slander and accusations. It is worth mentioning that Chinese classical literature is also sporadically dotted with gay love stories and poems, which is enough to shock Western Christian missionaries. 
The earliest recorded homosexuality in China was in the Shang and Zhou dynasties (16th to 11th centuries BC). The “Masters on the Records of the Grand Historian” and “Han Shu” in Chinese historical books once recorded that almost all the emperors of the Western Han Dynasty (202 BC to 8 AD) had homosexuals. Until today, people still talk about the “broken sleeves,” an allusion to gay love. Emperor Ai of Han and Dong Xian slept together, and Dong Xian held down the emperor’s sleeve. Emperor Ai can’t bear to disturb Dong Xian, so he cuts down his sleeve to get up. Descendants then used the term “broken sleeves” to describe homosexual relationships. 
During the Cultural Revolution (1966-1976), homosexuality suffered the worst historical setback. The government at the time believed that homosexuality was a mental illness and would bring shame to society as a whole. Since then, homosexual acts have been found to have committed hooliganism or disturbing social order, and homosexuals had to go underground.
